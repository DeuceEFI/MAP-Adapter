# SSOP-8 to SOP-8 Adapter board for Jaguar 0.4-alpha to 0.7-alpha PCBs

JAG 06/16/2014 0017 EDT (GMT-0400)

### Introduction

This adapter board allows the use of the Freescale SSOP-8 (Super Small Outline Package) pressure sensors to be used for the MAP or AAP sensors on the Jaguar 0.4-alpha to 0.7-alpha PCBs.  The adapter board/sensor can be soldered on by hand or by reflow oven.

Please see forum.diyefi.org for the most up to date information and links for this project and all of the other aspects of the FreeEMS project.

### Goals

The goal of this adapter board is to allow users who want to use the smaller footprint SSOP-8 sensors with the existing Jaguar PCBs which have the SOP-8 footprint pads.

### Status

This adapter board is ready for use.

### Changes

Please send any changes that you make to the MAP-Adapter project back upstream to Andy Goss' copy at https://github.com/DeuceEFI/MAP-Adapter
