JAG 06/15/2014 1417 EDT (GMT-0400)

### Introduction

This adapter board allows the use of the Freescale MPXH6400AC6 SSOP-8 (Super Small Outline Package) pressure sensors to be used for the MAP sensor on the Jaguar 0.4-alpha to 0.7-alpha PCBs using the three through hole pads marked "5v", "GND" and "MAP". 

Please see forum.diyefi.org for the most up to date information and links for this project and all of the other aspects of the FreeEMS project.

### Goals

The goal of this adapter board is to allow users who want to use higher pressure rated sensors with the existing Jaguar PCBs.

### Status

This adapter board is in the development process, please wait until the design has been reviewed before attempting to fabricate this PCB.

### Changes

Please send any changes that you make to the MAP-Adapter project back upstream to Andy Goss' copy at https://github.com/DeuceEFI/MAP-Adapter
